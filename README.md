## Privacy Policy

API Tester is designed to function entirely **locally within your Chrome browser**. It does **not** transmit any of your API request data, headers, parameters, or response bodies to any external servers controlled by the developer (that's us).

**Data Handling:**

* All the information you enter into the extension (URLs, methods, headers, parameters, request bodies) is processed and used solely within your browser to make the API calls directly to the target server you specify.
* The extension does **not** collect, store, log, or share this data outside of your local machine.
* The response data from the APIs you test is displayed directly within the extension in your browser and is not sent to any external servers controlled by the developer.
* We do **not** track your browsing history or any other information unrelated to your direct use of the API Tester extension.

**Permissions:**

The extension may require certain permissions to function correctly (e.g., `activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`). These permissions are used solely for the purpose of enabling the extension's features within your browser and are not used to collect or transmit personal or sensitive data externally.

**No External Data Collection:**

We want to assure you that we have no mechanisms in place to collect or access your API testing data once it's processed within your local Chrome browser.

If we ever introduce features that require the collection or transmission of data to external servers, we will clearly disclose this in a revised Privacy Policy and request your explicit consent.

**In summary, your API testing activity within the API Tester Chrome Extension remains private and local to your browser.**
